# Pop-The-Balloon---Python
Ariel Vainer

I initially began learning Python in 2020, but was unable to continue at the time. 
However, in 2022, I took a computer science class where I re-learned Python and also learned how to use Pygame to develop games. 
This sparked a passion for game development, and I have since made over 15 games using Python as well as other programming languages. 

This project was made for grade 11, computer science class.
